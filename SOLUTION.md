# SOLUTION.md

## Backend (Node.js/Express)

### 1. Refactor Blocking I/O

- **What was done:**  
  Replaced all synchronous file operations (`fs.readFileSync`, `fs.writeFileSync`) in `src/routes/items.js` with their asynchronous, non-blocking counterparts (`fs.promises.readFile`, `fs.promises.writeFile`).  
  **Result:** Prevents event loop blocking and improves overall server scalability and responsiveness.

---

### 2. Performance Optimization

- **What was done:**  
  Optimized the `/api/stats` endpoint by caching computed statistics and recalculating only when the underlying `items.json` file changes.  
  **Techniques:**  
    - File watcher to detect changes.
    - Smart cache validation.
  **Result:** Avoids redundant computations, greatly improving response times and reducing server load.

---

### 3. Testing

- **What was done:**  
  Added a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the items routes using **Jest** and **Supertest**.  
  **Coverage:**  
    - Happy paths (listing, filtering, retrieving, creating items)
    - Error scenarios (not found, internal errors)
  **Result:** Ensures correctness and robustness of the API.

## Frontend (React)

### 1. Memory Leak Prevention

- **What was done:**  
  Fixed a potential memory leak in the `Items.js` component by using `AbortController` to cancel fetches if the component unmounts before completion.  
  **Result:** Prevents state updates on unmounted components, improving stability.

---

### 2. Pagination & Server-Side Search

- **What was done:**  
  Implemented paginated item loading with server-side search (`q` parameter), contributing logic to both frontend and backend.  
  **Features:**  
    - `page` and `limit` for pagination
    - Search triggers a fresh fetch and resets pagination

---

### 3. Performance: Virtualized List

- **What was done:**  
  Integrated **react-window** for list virtualization in the item list.  
  **Result:** Only renders visible rows, ensuring a smooth experience even with thousands of items.

---

### 4. UI/UX Polish

- **What was done:**  
  Enhanced UI using **Material UI (MUI)** with:  
    - Improved styling and layout
    - Skeleton loaders and progress indicators for loading states
    - Better accessibility and keyboard navigation
    - Clear feedback for empty/error/loading states

---

### 5. Environment Variables (`.env`)

- **What was done:**  
  - Added a `.env_example` template for environment variables (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_URL`).
  - Developers should copy to `.env` and adjust as needed.
  - API URLs are now dynamic via `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` instead of hardcoded.
  **Result:**  
  Flexible, environment-specific configuration and easier setup for different environments.

---

**Summary:**  
These backend and frontend improvements make the application significantly more robust, performant, and maintainable, while also providing a more polished and professional user experience.
